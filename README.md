This plugin provides all the functionality of the [TRU Writer SPLOT theme](http://github.com/cogdog/truwriter) but now can be used in any WordPress theme.

At this point it's so beta there's no documentation here. 

On activation, the plugin *should* create two Pages in your site; one acts as the gatekeeper if you require an access code to write. The other Page hosts the form to compose new content. Any page can serve as the writing page as long as it contains a `[writerform]` shortcode to initiate the form. The SPLOT Writer option let's you select which page serves as the writing form.
